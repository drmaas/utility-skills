# Phase 5 — Implementation (loop per phase)

Goal: execute one phase of `checklist.md`, in a fresh-context subagent, and update the checklist.

This phase repeats for every phase in `checklist.md`. Each iteration is its own fresh subagent.

## Subagent prompt

Spawn a fresh subagent via the `task` tool with `subagent_type: generalPurpose` (or `general-purpose` if that is the harness name). Select the model for role `coding` via `../models.md` (phase → role → fit / complexity / constraints). Pass the chosen id through the harness native model mechanism (Task `model` parameter, prompt prefix, or CLI flag).

Prompt template: `templates/implement-prompt.md`, parameterized with the current phase identifier (e.g. "Phase 1" or "Phase 2").

The subagent must:

- Read `docs/decisions/<feature>/plan.md`, `checklist.md`, and `research.md`. Read `prd.md` if needed. If this phase includes contract tooling or interface changes, update `docs/contracts.md` in the same phase.
- Read `## Implementation strategy` from `plan.md`. If TDD: write the tests listed in the phase's acceptance criteria first, run them and capture the red state, then implement. If Code first: implement, then add the same tests. Do not switch strategy mid-phase. If the strategy is wrong for this phase, stop and report.
- Implement only the tasks for the current phase. Do not start the next phase.
- Check off tasks in `checklist.md` as they complete. Do not delete unchecked items; the reviewer needs to see what was skipped.
- Run the repository's canonical validation command after the phase. Record the output.
- Stop and report if any acceptance criterion cannot be met. Do not invent workarounds.
- Self-review once. Catch and fix obvious issues.
- Return a one-paragraph summary: what was done, the implementation strategy followed, validation result, anything skipped or deferred, and (for TDD) the recorded red state.

## Scope discipline

- The implementer may not introduce abstractions, helpers, or configuration that the plan did not call for.
- The implementer may not start the next phase, even if it has time.
- The implementer may not amend `plan.md` or `checklist.md` beyond checking off its own tasks.

## Human gate

No human gate in the implementer step. The gate is in phase 6 (implementation review).

## Exit conditions

- All tasks for the current phase are checked off or explicitly deferred.
- Repository validation command passed.
- Subagent returned its summary.
- The implementation matched the strategy recorded in `plan.md` `## Implementation strategy`.

Move to `phases/06-verify.md` (the per-iteration verify step). Only move to `phases/07-implement-review.md` after verify returns green.
